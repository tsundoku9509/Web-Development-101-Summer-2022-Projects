What does a Koala bear look like?
Koalas have soft, wool-like fur that is gray above and white below. Their fur is mostly white on the underside below the neck, and their ears have long
white hairs on the tips. The koala resembles a bear, but is actually a marsupial, a special kind of mammal which carries its young in a pouch.

years.

Nocturnal mammals, koalas sleep for up to 16 hours a day. They are arboreal, which means that they live in trees. They do not live in big groups but
rather prefer to be alone.

How do Koala's populate?
Koalas breed once a year. Gestation lasts 35 days, after which one koala is born. The baby koala is very small when it is born, and lives in its
mother's pouch for five to seven months. After this time, koalas gradually become independent and survive on their own.

What are some major threats of Koala's?
Once numbering in the millions, koalas suffered major declines in population during the 1920s when they were hunted for their fur. Today, habitat
destruction, traffic deaths, and attacks by dogs kill an estimated 4,000 koalas yearly.

How can we protect Koala's?
Australian national laws protect koalas, but each individual state is responsible for the animal's conservation.
