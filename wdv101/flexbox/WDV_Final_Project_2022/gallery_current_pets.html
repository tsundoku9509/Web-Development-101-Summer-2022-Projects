        <h3>SNOWBALL & SALLY:</h3>
            <li>6 months old, spayed female domestic shorthairs, 4 lbs. (Snowball) and 5 lbs. (Sally)</li>
            <li>If you're looking to bring some love and joy into your home, look no further than these two girls.</li> 
            <li>They're 6-month-old rescues—amazingly sweet and loving. They're affectionate (big-time purrers and cuddlers), playful, and endlessly entertaining.</li> 
            <li>They are also healthy, have had their shots, have been spayed, and are litterbox trained.</li>
            <li>Because they've bonded to each other, we'd like to keep them together.</li>
          </ul>
        <ul class="pets_now">
          <h3>ASTRO:</h3>
          <li>Astro loves people!</li>
          <li>Astro: 2 years old, neutered male, domestic shorthair, 11 lbs</li>
            <li>Astro can thank his lucky stars, because after a car hit him, he made it out of the vet hospital in Springfield and found a temporary home with us. Astro's a little nervous, but once he settles down, he loves people to pet him. He's lean and lanky, and even though we think he's fit to run a kitty marathon, he weighs almost 12 pounds!</li>
            <li>Astro is a sweetheart, but he's very scared right now. Come meet with him and see what a great guy he can be. Maybe you can give him his forever home!</li>
            <li>For information about Astro, call Jessica at Pets to Go: (555) 555-5555.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="pets_now">
          <h3>CINDY:</h3>
          <li>A High-Energy Bundle of Fun</li>
          <li>3 years old, spayed female, Shepherd mix, 40 lbs.</li>
          <li>Cindy came to us because her family was splitting up. She's never gotten the attention a young dog needs.</li>
          <li>Cindy is super playful. She loves toys, and her favorite game is fetch. She's a smart cookie and adapts well to positive training. She already knows “sit,” “down,” “stay,” “shake,” and “sit pretty,” and she's learning more fun tricks like “roll over.” Cindy is house-trained, rides well in the car, and enjoys being brushed and groomed. She behaves well around the house and respects her boundaries.</li>
          <li>This special girl needs an adult-only home with people who have experience with large dogs, so she can continue to develop into a well-adjusted dog. Cindy needs someone who'll give her very clear rules, lots of love, and plenty of exercise. In return, she'll be your loyal friend for life.</li>
