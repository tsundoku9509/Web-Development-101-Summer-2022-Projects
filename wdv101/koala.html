  <p>
    The Koala Bear National Information Center  (KBNIC) is the principal non-profit, non-government organization dedicated
    to the conservation and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.
  </p>

  <p>
    The KBNIC was formed in 2006. Since our founding  the KBNIC has grown from a small group of people interested in
    researching koala disease, to a well-known, global organization with a strong track record in strategic koala research,
    conservation and community education with a huge focus on mapping -- our absolute strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    Koalas are disappearing. Loss of koala habitat and koala food trees (eucalyptus leaves) is the leading koala threat.
    Our cuddly koalas are loved around the world. Often called a koala bear, they are actually marsupials not koala bears.
    Please help koalas by supporting the Australian Koala Foundation.
